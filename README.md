# Health Intelligence & Dietary Risk Analytics Platform

##  Project Overview

This project analyzes 45,000+ food products to evaluate:

- Nutritional quality (NutriScore)
- Processing levels (NOVA classification)
- Allergen prevalence
- Dietary compatibility
- Health segmentation insights

The objective is to simulate analytics for a HealthTech SaaS platform that provides personalized nutrition intelligence.

##  Tools Used

- SQL Server (T-SQL)
- Power BI
- GitHub

##  Dataset

Source: Kaggle – Comprehensive Food & Nutrition Database  
File used: foods_health_scores_allergens.csv  

The dataset contains:

- NutriScore grades
- NOVA processing groups
- Allergen flags
- Macronutrient values
- Dietary compatibility information

---

## Business Questions

1. How are products distributed across NutriScore grades?
2. Are ultra-processed foods associated with lower health scores?
3. What is the prevalence of common allergens?
4. Which categories lack healthy or diet-compatible options?
5. Can we identify high-quality food clusters for recommendation engines?
